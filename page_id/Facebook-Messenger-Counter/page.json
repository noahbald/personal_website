        "The Facebook Messenger Counter app is a web app, wherein users can upload their messenger data, and the app will return useful data and visualisations.",
        "If you'd like to try out the app yourself all you have to do is navigate to Facebook, to settings, and then to 'Your Facebook information'. Select download your information and from here tweak your settings so that you're downloading only messages in a JSON format.
Once your data has downloaded you can make your way to the app and upload the JSON file you want to be analysed.",
        "My main objective of this app was to fulfil three goals. To exercise and prove the skills I've gained studying at university, to learn new and valuable skills, and to create something genuinely useful to other people. I believe that I was successful in achieving these goals I put out for myself.
I've been able to use my previous knowledge of programming, usability, version control and much more to create a polished and efficient experience.",
        "Regarding what I've learnt, it's been invaluable. Each roadblock I've met and overcome has given me a small piece of knowledge that's helped me become a better programmer. Not to mention the tools and frameworks I've taught myself, including React, jQuery, and web hosting.
The next step in my plan is to share this app over social media to provide people with something useful and hopefully receive some helpful feedback."
