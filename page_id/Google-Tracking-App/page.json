        "As a part of our studies into Software Engineering Process and Management, we were given a semester-long project to introduce us to Agile development and working on a project as a team. Our project was to create a program to alarm the user if a change was detected on a Google document using the Scrum methodology.",
        "Scrum's methodology emphasises frequent 'sprints' of development, where a set of user-defined stories are completed. At the end of each sprint, we would demonstrate our development to the product owner and hold a retrospective to see how our sprints could improve.",
        "My role in the development was the user-interface and the subscription's context functionality. The other team members worked on the other contexts and the system's back-end. So I was responsible for the appearance of the program and how the users could interact with their subscriptions, including displaying, unsubscribing, and opening documents.",
        "The client program was written in Python and the backend in Node JS. For the UI we used PyQt 5 and styled our program following the Material guidelines so that it would be familiar to Google Drive users.",
        "Our team ended up getting a high-distinction mark for our project and our ability to follow the Scrum methodology effectively."
