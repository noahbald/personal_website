        "After several months of covering the basics of JavaScript, JSON, and the software engineering process our team of four was challenged to develop a web app which could use the phone's GPS and Google's API to generate and track a user's run. The app was tailored towards the phones specialised hardware, exploiting the device's GPS, portability, and touchscreen.",
        "The team-based aspect of this project forced us to deal with the shortcomings and advantages of working with others. The first steps of the development started slowly as we were still getting to know each other, however, we soon became synergetic and all worked together efficiently. We took advantage of several software solutions, including GitKraken, Asana, and Google Docs to track and assist us with development.",
        "With the actual design and development of the app, we had much to consider. As is rudimentary to computer science, and software, in general, we had to consider the security, performance, and effectiveness of the program. Thus, we considered prototyping, UI design, requirements analysis, and software verification.",
        "While this project was covered early on in my degree, and therefore only covers a beginners approach to software engineering, I was able to work well in a team and use my prior knowledge in programming to excel in the unit."
