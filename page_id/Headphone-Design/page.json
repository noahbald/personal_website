        "Upon the completion of the logo for the insubstantial company Minerva, it was time to start tackling the second part of their project. As described by the organisation, I was required design a new pair of headphones for them in a way that could be interpreted within the company, that is, to manufacturers and the clientele themselves, in a way that presents the headphones with a clear marketing direction.",
        "I began my research by producing observations of headphones which I owned, as well as looking at unique features of other popular headphone models. I was now ready to generate my own designs. Following the creation of some rough headphone designs, I iterated and improved upon several conceptions which I appreciated, which included deciding the materials, colours, and a more rigid visual description. I decided that to present the product I would show it as a fourth-angle orthographic projection but in a more informal, presentable manner.",
        "This particular project took a lot of effort and time to produce, I think it goes to show how much work I put into things which I am passionate and excited about. If you'd like to view the portfolio in its entirety, you can download it <a>here</a>."
