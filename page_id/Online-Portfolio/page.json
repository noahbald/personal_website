        "Inspired by the creations of others and a few of my friends, I decided that I should spend time creating my own online portfolio. I knew that consequentially this project would be important for future employment; it makes my work more accessible to companies and in and of itself proves my dedication, and so I began.",
        "I hit the ground running by scouring the web for other's websites and pulling from them certain elements and principles which I liked. After a few hours of research, I drew an outline of what I wanted my website to look like and the contents which would be included.",
        "And so, with the planning stage done, I began the weighty part of the process: actually developing the site.",
        "<p>My aim was to create something which was presentable and appeared professional, and of course, something that was mine; so I wouldn't follow any templates or blatantly copy others. After some time, I had created enough structure that a skeleton of site existed, and from that, I could chisel it down into whatever use I'd need, notably mainly a home page, and pages for projects."
