            <p>As a part of our studies into Software Engineering Process and Management, we were given a semester-long project to introduce us to Agile development and working on a project as a team. Our project was to create a program to alarm the user if a change was detected on a Google document using the Scrum methodology.</p>
            <p>Scrum's methodology emphasises frequent 'sprints' of development, where a set of user-defined stories are completed. At the end of each sprint, we would demonstrate our development to the product owner and hold a retrospective to see how our sprints could improve.</p>
            <p>My role in the development was the user-interface and the subscription's context functionality. The other team members worked on the other contexts and the system's back-end. So I was responsible for the appearance of the program and how the users could interact with their subscriptions, including displaying, unsubscribing, and opening documents.</p>
            <p>The client program was written in Python and the backend in Node JS. For the UI we used PyQt 5 and styled our program following the Material guidelines so that it would be familiar to Google Drive users.</p>
            <p>Our team ended up getting a high-distinction mark for our project and our ability to follow the Scrum methodology effectively.</p>
