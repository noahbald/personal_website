            <p>Our class was required to explore the three major studies of visual communication design, that is, industrial, communication, and environmental design. While we weren't given much choice into what we would work on, we could approach it however we liked.</p>
            <p>Starting with industrial design we were required to create a design for a drink bottle. I decided to tailor my bottle to the context of a hospital, and thus meet the hygienic and safety requirements of such a place. Following that was an environmental design where we had to alter and add a floor to an existing floor plan, and from that conceptualise what the house may look in using many forms of visualisation. Lastly, we were tasked with the design of a communication, more specifically, a poster for a food convention. I decided to base my design around an 80s/90s themed food convention, due to my then fascination with vaporwave, and these influences can be strongly seen in the final.</p>
            <p>While this portion of the subject was particularly minor, I'm still proud of it. If you'd like to view the portfolio in its entirety, you can download it here.</p>
