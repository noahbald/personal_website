            <h1>Logo Design | <a>VCE</a></h1>
            <div class="block double"></div>
            <h2>As a part of my Visual Communication Design studies for VCE I synthesised a company with two design needs: a company logo and a pair of headphones; and to relate it to their namesake, the Goddess Minerva.</h2>

                    <p>A mock document showing off the logo in a particular context</p>

            <p>The needs for the logo, as described by the faux company was to 'range for any gender from 16-60 years old' so it 'can be identified by as many people as possible', mainly appealing to those with an 'average to high income' or 'sound engineers and music producers'.</p>
            <p>The research stage involved the analysis of audio logos, logos from successful companies, and analysing visual elements from music/sound and Minerva's mythology/cult. From this, I decided to extract certain elements, such as waveforms, Minerva's comet, the Owl of Minerva and also how I could manipulate the typography of 'Minerva'. Ultimately I ended up basing the design on the Owl of Minerva while retaining an emphasis on ratios.</p>
            <p>Lo and behold, I had created the company's logo, however, I wasn't done yet. I had to present the logo in a way that wouldn't just show the logo, but rather to show off how the logo could be used in various contexts for the company. So to display the poster I created a final image which simultaneously presented the logo upon a car, a document, a shirt, and headphones.</p>
            <p>I believe this project shows off not only my ability to design and think creatively, but also to work within specific constraints for a client; to work within a limited time frame, meet a specific purpose, and to respond to feedback.
